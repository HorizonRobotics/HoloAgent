> ***FSR-VLN*** is a core component of the HoloAgent framework and will be open-sourced soon. It provides natural language guided navigation and intelligent interaction for general-purpose robots, and is built on core agent components such as mapping and localization, multimodal perception, decision-making and planning, and memory management. At its core, FSR-VLN is a vision–language navigation system that integrates a Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph (HMSG) for coarse-to-fine environment representation with Fast-to-Slow Navigation Reasoning (FSR), leveraging VLM-driven refinement to enable efficient, real-time, long-range spatial reasoning.
